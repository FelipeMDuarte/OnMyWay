# OnMyWay
Trabalho da disciplina de Software para Smartphone 2016/1

## Synopsis

The app will act in two fronts, for users who wants to inform someone that something happened in their way and for users who wants to know if someone didn’t complete their route for some reason.

## Motivation

In the light of the large numbers of assaults and kidnaps, we have a habit of calling when we arrive at our destination to warn to a acquainted that we got there ok. The app goal is to do this automatically and also warn when we do not arrive for some reason and the search for apps that in some way help the users to deal with this problems has increased.

###Extra Features

Your contacts beeing able to track you in real time if you allow them.

## Usage

Open “On My Way” and configure your trusted contacts informations. After that you are able to set a destination and estimated arrival time to finally start your trip. During your trip you are allowed to “finish” or “add more time to your arrival time” if you want it. In case you don’t arrive on time the application will send a notification through e-mail and SMS to your trusted contacts warning them to be in touch with you and showing them your route until that time.
